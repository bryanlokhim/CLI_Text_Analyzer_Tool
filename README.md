# CLI_Text_Analyzer_Tool
CLI Text Analyzer: A Python tool to analyze text files, built for my PCAP certification portfolio. Counts lines, chars, words, unique words, and searches keywords (case-insensitive). Cleans non-alphabetic chars (e.g., "test." â†’ "test"). Shows skills in file I/O, argparse, and error handling. Clone and try it! (280 chars)
