A lightweight Python CLI tool to analyze text files with ease. Built to count lines, characters, words, unique words, and search for keywords, this project showcases **clean code**, **error handling**, and **command-line argument parsing** using Python's `argparse` module. Perfect for developers, data analysts, or anyone curious about text file insights!

## üöÄ Why I Built This
I created this tool to explore **file I/O**, **text processing**, and **CLI development** in Python while solving a practical problem: quickly extracting meaningful stats from text files. Whether you're analyzing logs, manuscripts, or datasets, this tool delivers fast, reliable results with a user-friendly interface.

## ‚ú® Features
- **Line Count**: Total number of lines in the file.
- **Character Count**: Total characters (excluding newlines).
- **Word Count**: Total words (punctuation removed).
- **Unique Words**: Case-insensitive count of unique words.
- **Keyword Search**: Find occurrences of a specific word (case-insensitive).
- **Robust Error Handling**: Gracefully handles missing files and unexpected errors.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
- **Python 3.x**: Core programming language.
- **argparse**: For parsing command-line arguments.
- **File I/O**: Reading and processing text files.
- **String Manipulation**: Cleaning and analyzing text data.
